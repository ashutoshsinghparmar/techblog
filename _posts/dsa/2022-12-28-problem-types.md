#### Techniques  

#### Tricks  
- Prefix Sum  
- Kadane  

#### Bit Manipulations  
- operation `n & n-1` will be 0 for a number `n` if its a multiple of 2  
- Addition of 2 numbers without using operators  
  - 2 Operations are used XOR and And with left shift  
  - Addition of 1[01] and 1[01] = 2[10], its carry in binary addition  
    - If both bits are ON, addition of these 2 produces OFF bit with carry  
  - AND operation between 2 nos when shifted 1 bit left will give carry bits during addition
